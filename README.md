# django-image-exif-rotation

If you are building a forum/blog, you want to enable users to add Pictures where pictures have different orientation when they are captured in the devices. So images once you upload to a server might change their orientation and rotate. This repository has sample code to use for correctly rotating the images based on the EXIF orientation.


Raise a <a href="https://github.com/JoelRajVarma/django-image-exif-rotation/issues" > github ticket</a> if you want to report any bug! Happy to help :)
